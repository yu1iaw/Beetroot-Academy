            I was born on October 26, 1988 in Donetsk. I have a high school
            education, my specialty is sports management. I went through an array of tennis, swimming, and modern
            pentathlon. I liked it all, but it was expensive and beyond human capabilities according to my feelings. So
            far, the only thing I would agree to teach is the infinite loop of starting from scratch.

            I switched to IT in 2022 and enjoy the company of letters and numbers. There are minimal distractions (I
            still enjoy watching sports and reading plus I finally learned how to cook), I'm single,
            have no children, I'm going to get a
            dachshund and selflessly love my pet. If you wish to spoil such an idyll, contact me via <a
            href="https://t.me/yu1iaw" target="_blank"><b>Telegram</b></a>. If you
            just do me a favor by offering me a job, I'll appreciate it.
